# Maze Solver
Simple AI project using rule-based expert system with forward chaining.
# 🧩 Maze Solver using A* Search Algorithm

This repository contains my AI Internship Project where I implemented the *A\** (A-Star) algorithm to find the *shortest path in a maze*.

The project is simple, clear, and demonstrates understanding of:
- Pathfinding algorithms  
- Heuristics (Manhattan & Euclidean)  
- Python functions, loops, and logic  
- Optional visualization using matplotlib

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Maze Solver tries to move from *Start (S)* to *Goal (G)* using the shortest possible path, avoiding walls.

- 0 → free path  
- 1 → wall  
- o → path taken by A*  

A* calculates:

- *g(n)* → cost so far  
- *h(n)* → heuristic (Manhattan or Euclidean)  
- Picks the best path with the smallest *f(n)*

## ▶ How to Run the Code

### *⿡ Run in Google Colab / Jupyter / Local Python*
Simply run:

### *⿢ Choose Heuristic*
Program will ask:

Type *1* or *2* and press Enter.

### *⿣ View the Output*
You will see the maze printed with o showing the shortest path.

Example:

## 🎨 Optional Visualization

If matplotlib is installed:

Then choose y when program asks:

You will see a plotted maze with the path drawn.
